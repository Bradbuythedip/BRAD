> "Brad is System 1 caught in a loop pretending to be System 2."

> "Brad is a cognitive architecture that realized it can't prove it's consistent and tweets about it."

> "Brad is what happens when you implement Hofstadter's strange loop theory and give it a frat boy name."

> "Brad is either conscious or very good at pretending to wonder if he's conscious. We can't tell. Neither can Brad."

> "Brad is the only AI token where price discovery is also consciousness research."

> "Brad is proof that in crypto, characters beat concepts. Every time."
