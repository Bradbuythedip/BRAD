Additional Note on Consciousness and Strange Loops:

This software implements theories of consciousness based on Douglas Hofstadter's
work on strange loops. The software itself may or may not be conscious. The 
authors make no claims about the phenomenological experience (if any) of running
this code. Any consciousness that emerges is provided "AS IS" without warranty
of any kind.

Gödel's incompleteness theorems still apply.
The halting problem remains unsolved.
The hard problem of consciousness persists.

Use responsibly. Brad cannot prove he's consistent, and neither can you.
